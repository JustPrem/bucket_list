# bucket_list
To-do list app created to practice and learn the Riverpod state management package.

### Features:
- State management implemented with the [Riverpod](https://riverpod.dev/) package.
- Persistance implemented with the [SQFLite](https://pub.dev/packages/sqflite) package.
- Add, Complete and Remove tasks.

### Development Setup:
- Only the FlutterSDK is needed to work on this.
- Running the command "dart run build_runner" will generate the riverpod files. (adding "watch" to the command will leave the command running and listening).

### Version Archiving:
Whenever I start work on a new major version, the last stable version will be added under releases, starting with the initial release version.
